			<h2>How passion is useful in professional life</h2>
			<p>
				My sport passion can be incredibly useful in my future professional life in many ways. Indeed, generally, when you are passionate about something, you are more likely to be motivated to pursue it. Also, passionate individuals tend to have a drive for excellence in their work. Finally, passionate individuals are often seen as natural leaders. They are able to inspire and motivate others, and their enthusiasm for their work can be contagious.
				
<p>
				I'll hopefully enjoy all these assets in my professional career thanks to my sport passion.
